# Stock Portfolio Dashboard

## About
The purpose of this project was to continue to develop my web development skills while also learning more about stock trading. 
The current aim is to implement the features from RobinHoodâ€™s website that I find intuitive and user friendly, while giving myself the freedom to make any changes that I may find useful. The front end uses Angular and Bootstrap and the backend is written in Django.

Here is a sample image of the current dashboard. Please ignore my choice of stocks, I am a fool when it comes to trading.
